          <h3>Ron Magill Conservation Endowment Portfolio </h3>
          <p>The <a href="https://ronmagillconservation.com/">Ron Magill Conservation Endowment</a> strives to ensure support for international
          wildlife conservation projects with the use of its funding to instill perpetuity. </p>

          <p>As one of the three leading people on this campaign project for the Ron Magill Conservation Endowment, I played a pivotal role in designing
            the campaign, which included: brochures, calendar, a 44 page booklet, posters, and logos.</p>

          <p>Below you will find the booklet, going into detail of the work done on the campaign along with the designs that were created.</p>
